1. Given an array of INTs, calculate the sum of even numbers in the array using 4 go routines in two different ways(using channels, using WaitGroup).
2. In the crawler directory, make the Crawl function parse the urls in a parallel manner(go routines)
Hint: you can use a map for checking which urls are visited
