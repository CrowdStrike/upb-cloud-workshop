1. Create 5 more routes (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for the book-app provided in the demo. For each route create another external dependency such as the Storage one. Try and test the endpoints as well as you can. Tests should cover as much as the code as possible so for every if we must have at least one unit test (so we can make sure we do the correct handling of an error). You could also rewrite the api by removing the books map from the api object an injecting it from an external dependency.
